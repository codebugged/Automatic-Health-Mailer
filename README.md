## The SMTP Protocol
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, a protocol for sending e-mail messages between servers. Most e-mail systems that send mail over the Internet use SMTP to send messages from one server to another; the messages can then be retrieved with an e-mail client using either POP or IMAP.
This project can be integrated with fitness bands and other devices which could send the features on cloud and then return the disease prediction along with remedies. Also incase of serious issue it can raise alarms.
